Endless Appetizers

Life is a like a box of of mozzarella sticks. You never know what you're gonna get, but you can 
predict with 100 percent accuracy that it will be a mozzarella stick.

Chef's colleague issued a challenge to Chef: "If you eat more than X mozzarella sticks, I'll give you 30 rupees 
for each extra one you eat".
For example, if X=5 and Chef eats 8 sticks, he would receive 90 rupees because he ate 3 extra sticks.

You know that the restaurant serves Y mozzarella sticks per plate.
You also know that Chef received R rupees from his colleague as a result of the challenge.

What's the maximum number of plates of mozzarella sticks that Chef could have ordered?

Note:

    Chef won't order a new plate till he finishes eating all the sticks from the previous one.
    However, it's possible that Chef didn't finish all the sticks from the final plate he ordered.
    See the explained examples below for more clarification.

Input Format:
    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    Each test case consists of one line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,Y, and R 
    — the lower limit on the number of sticks, the number of sticks on a single plate, and the money 
    received by Chef.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the maximum number of plates Chef could have ordered.

Constraints:
    1≤T≤104
    1≤X≤100
    1≤Y≤10
    0≤R≤3⋅104
    It is guaranteed that RR is a multiple of 30.

Sample 1:
Input:
4
7 5 30
16 5 0
15 9 120
23 1 2130
Output:
2
4
3
94

Explanation:

Test case 1: Chef received 30 rupees; meaning he ate 1 extra stick.
Since X=7, this means he must've eaten exactly 8 sticks.
At 5 sticks per plate, Chef would need 2 plates to eat 8 sticks 
(and two sticks from the second plate will remain uneaten).

Test case 2: Chef received 0 rupees. Since X=16, this means he ate ≤16 sticks.
The maximum he could've eaten is exactly 16; and this would require 4 plates since each plate has 55 sticks.

Test case 3: Chef received 120 rupees, meaning he ate 4 extra sticks.
This makes for a total of 15+4=19 sticks, and at 9 sticks per plate he would need 3 plates.
